Seeing the current scenario of the global pandemic due to COVID-19 there has been
a great challenge and setback for the medical department all over the globe. Regular
working of hospitals has been affected to a great extent. Due to all the chaos there
are certain areas of medical which are suffering a lot due to this pandemic and one
such is Blood Bank Department. Now a days people are not able to come forward
and stand in queues to donate blood for the needy people, quarantine has stopped
the blood donation inflow in these banks due to which blood stock in the reservoirs
has been decreasing and its an alarming situation for people with kidney problems,
liver problems, haemophilia, anaemia etc because they wont be getting blood after
certain time. So to solve this, Blood Bank Portal is the best idea to implement. In this
Admin can login and manage list of blood groups, registered blood groups, total
queries filed, work on information about all the donors etc. The users on other hand
can file any query they have with adequate information and a message, they can
register themselves for blood donation so that blood bank employee can come at
their place to collect blood and many more such features are included in this project.

This system has tables describing :-

1) Admin

2) Blood Donor Details

3) Blood Group Details

4) Contact US Information

5) Contact Us Query

6) Sub-Pages in a Website

This Website uses php, bootstrap, css, javascript and most importantly SQL
